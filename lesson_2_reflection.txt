What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A hidden directory ".git" is created. All the meta-data related to
	the version control function will be stored in the .git directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the r-
pository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is the middle area between the working directory and the reposi-tory. It can allow you put multiple files you want to commit their
	changes together in the staging area before committed.
