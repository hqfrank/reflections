How is the staging area different from the working directory and the r-
pository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is the middle area between the working directory and the reposi-tory. It can allow you put multiple files you want to commit their
	changes together in the staging area before committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

	I can use git add to add the logical change related file to the staging area, and then use git diff to compare the files between the working directory and the staging area to find out the change I have made on the file. If it has already completed a logical change, I can use git commit to commit that change.
